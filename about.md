<h2>About</h2>

I currently work on pulsar timing, gravitational waves and I sometimes dabble 
in astrophysical hydrodynamics. I'm widely interested in using astrophysical systems
to test physics on various scales. You can find details of my published and non-published (Multiple MSc projects) 
work in the projects section of this website.  I'm a member of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array ([InPTA]), 
a collaboration of Indian and Japanese Astronomers using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope near Pune, India,
Using pulsars as a tool to detect low frequency gravitational waves from merging Supermassive Black Holes. 
I regularly contribute to ongoing research projects, data analysis, observations and outreach with the InPTA.

You can find my detailed [CV] here
