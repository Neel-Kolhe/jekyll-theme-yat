<h2>About</h2>
I'm currently a PhD candidate at the Paris Observatory studying the dynamics of irregular galaxies, 
particularly in the local group, to gain insights on the role of the IGM in cosmology.
Currently I am using 21 cm observations from the MEERKAT radio telescope and the hydrodynamical code GIZMO for the same.

In the past I have worked with the Indian Pulsar Timing Array collaboration, something which is currently on ice due to commitments to other projects,
but something I hope to go back to in my spare time when I have some more breathing room. 

I also with several long time friends and collaborators work on developing novel instrumentation and experiments to teach
