In summer 2020 as a part of the visiting student research program at the National Center for Radio Astrophysics,
I studied the temperature of neutral hydrogen along quasar sightlines using the 21cm line with Professor Nissim Kanekar. 
The prevailing theory on the spin temperatures of Neutral hydrogen distributed in the Milky Way suggest that most of it exist in 2 phases, 
the cold neutral medium which is expected to be between 40K to 200K and a warm neutral medium which is expected to be between 5000K to 8000K. 
On the contrary to this, there has been consistent evidence provided by folks such as [Roy et.al 2013], that there exists a third thermally unstable phase between 200K to 5000K.

Basing our methodology on their approach and some available data from WSRT, GMRT, etc along 7 quasar sightlines, we tried to estimate the spin temperature in absorption. 
There is a relation between the spin temperature and the width of each component of absorption along the sightline, we attempted a gaussian fit to get these widths and eventually temperatures. 
Our results seemed to agree with the conclusions of [Roy et.al 2013] that most of the gaussian components had a spin temperature between 5000K to 8000K. 
This was my first foray into using interferometric data, and radio astronomy in general, and I spent a lot of time understanding how an interferometer functions and also how best fit models work.
