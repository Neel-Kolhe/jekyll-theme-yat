In April of 2021 the pulsar PSR J1713-0747 underwent a profile change. Pulsar profiles are like the fingerprints of a pulsar and they can teach us a lot about the physical characteristics of the pulsar. 
Profile changes are very rare in millisecond pulsars such as J1713 and only a handful have been reported so far. 
Characterising these changes can be crucial for PTA experiments as a change in profile can accompany a change in timing, 
which can introduce timing noise in the PTA dataset. J1713 is one of the best timed pulsar in the International Pulsar Timing Array data sets, 
with a robust high signal to noise ratio time series in almost all of its prolonged observations. A profile change displayed by it therefore of particular interest.

<figcaption>Profile changes observed at Band 3 and Band 5 before and after MJD 59321 are shown in this figure. The colour-map plots show the variation in
profile with observation epochs indicated in MJD along the vertical axes for Band 3 (left plot) and Band 5 (right plot), respectively, where the profile change
epoch is indicated by arrows. The plots in the center show the frequency and time collapsed profiles before (I-A and I-B) and after (II-A and II-B) the event for
Band 3 (left plots), and Band 5 (right plots) as solid lines.</figcaption>



The Indian Pulsar Timing Array, along with other PTA organizations caught this profile change during their regular observations. It was observed in both band 3 and band 5 and the change is clearly visible in both.
 We launched a high cadence observation campaign to monitor the recovery.

<figcaption>A comparison of profiles before (left-hand column) and after (right-hand column) the profile change event with templates formed from epochs before
the event. The first and third rows show the profile comparisons in Bands 3 and 5, respectively where we have plotted the scaled and aligned profiles from two
representative epochs from before (MJD 59287) and after (MJD 59367) the event in arbitrary units. In the second and fourth rows, we plot respectively for
Bands 3 and 5, (a) the median profile differences computed from the profiles of all epochs before and after the event normalized by the corresponding off-pulse
RMS of the profiles as solid black line, and (b) the standard deviations of the profile differences normalized by the off-pulse RMS as grey filled area. A much
higher variability (∼12 times the off-pulse RMS) is seen for post-EoT profiles at Band 5 when compared to Band 3.</figcaption>


 I contributed to the observations using the uGMRT, data reduction, analysis and public outreach in this particular project. 
 This was my first experience working with a large number of collaborators, and it was a great learning experience to be able to coordinate with experts from disparate areas of expertise and help put it all together. 
 I gained experience with the telescope and the operations surrounding it, including phase calibration, how to create setups to avoid possible satellites which could be RFI sources, etc. It also gave me experience with pulsar science softwares like TEMPO2 and PSRCHIVE.  High cadence observation campaign of the pulsar continues and I will be a part of the team doing the follow up study. 
 
The change is more pronounced in band 5 than in band 3 and is showing a 159 day exponential recovery, which suggests there might have been magnetospheric changes in the pulsar which realigned the beams
 (which are now making a recovery) and it is unlikely to be an ISM event. Our results were published in MNRS-letters, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/507/1/L57/6356572">which you can find here</a>

<figcaption>The timing residuals for 4 sub-bands each in Bands 3 and 5 around
the profile change event are shown in this figure as black and grey points.
The dashed lines indicate a fit to an exponential dip model with chromatic
index as a free parameter α = −1.34. The residuals obtained by subtracting
the model from the data are shown in the bottom plot.</figcaption>
